   <p>When the first baby to be conceived using a technique that mixes genetic material from three people was born, in 2016, scientists worried that the procedure had not been studied to show it was safe. Now, scientists in China have conducted the first comprehensive study of the technique in early-stage human embryos, and report that it does not seem to affect their development1.</p>

   <p>With rivers breaking their banks, flash flooding and glacial lakes bursting, Pakistan is experiencing its worst floods this century. At least one-third of the country is under water. Scientists say several factors have contributed to the extreme event, which has displaced some 33 million people and killed more than 1,200. Researchers say the catastrophe probably started with phenomenal heatwaves. In April and May, temperatures reached above 40 °C for prolonged periods in many places. On one sweltering day in May, the city of Jacobabad topped 51 °C. “These were not normal heatwaves — they were the worst in the world. We had the hottest place on Earth in Pakistan,” says Malik Amin Aslam, the country’s former minister for climate change, who is based in Islamabad.</p>
